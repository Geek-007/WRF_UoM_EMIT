# WRF_UoM_EMIT

WRF_UoM_EMIT is an NCL based pre-processing script, for generating anthropogenic emissions files for use with WRF-Chem. It does not map emissions onto the model grid - this can be done using anthro_emis, or similar tools (which this tool will complement, rather than replace) - instead it is intended to be used for applying temporal and spatial variations to the emission data, mapping VOC emissions into chemical-scheme specific groupings, and combining emissions sectors into single emission variables.

## Overview<a name="Overview"></a>

The tool scripts are contained in the ``Processing_Scripts`` directory, while example source file headers are provided in the ``emission_source_files_example`` directory. The principal tool script is ``MAIN_emission_processing.ncl``. At the head of this script you can set the run-time options controlling the process of emission generation, the rest of the script organises the calling of the processing functions (in scripts ``diurnal_cycle_routines.ncl``, ``preprocess_emissions_routines.ncl``, ``speciating_emissions_routines.ncl``, and ``vertical_distribution_routines.ncl``). Settings for the different input and output schemes, and data for the different processing options, are stored in a variety of files ending ``*data.ncl``


## Dependencies<a name="Dependencies"></a>

WRF_UoM_EMIT has been written in NCL (https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/); it has been tested with version 6.3.0. Input files are generated using anthro_emis (https://www2.acom.ucar.edu/wrf-chem/wrf-chem-tools-community); example configuration scripts for using this tool with EDGAR-HTAP emissions datasets are available in this repository: https://github.com/douglowe/PROMOTE-emissions .

## Inputs<a name="Inputs"></a>

WRF_UoM_EMIT takes two sets of input files. The first are general emission variables, the second are the NMVOC emission variables. 

The general emission variables should be in input files with the following naming convention:
wrfchemi\_[HH]z\_[domain]\_[YYYY]\_[MM]

The NMVOC emission variables should be in input files with the following naming convention:
wrfchemi\_[HH]z\_NMVOC\_[domain]\_[YYYY]\_[MM]

[HH] will be the hour of day (either 00 or 12 - as generated by anthro_emis using option **XX**). [domain] will be the model domain (d01, d02, etc), [YYYY] will be a 4-digit year, and [MM] will be a 2 digit month.

The standard input datasets supported are:
* EDGAR-HTAP
* SAFAR

The NMVOC input datasets supported are:
* MACCity
* EDGAR v4.3.2

These lists will be amended as more options are added.
