# WRF_UoM_EMIT

WRF_UoM_EMIT is an NCL based pre-processing script, for generating anthropogenic emissions files for use with WRF-Chem. It does not map emissions onto the model grid - this can be done using anthro_emis, or similar tools (which this tool will complement, rather than replace) - instead it is intended to be used for applying temporal and spatial variations to the emission data, mapping VOC emissions into chemical-scheme specific groupings, and combining emissions sectors into single emission variables.

## Overview<a name="Overview"></a>

The tool scripts are contained in the ``Processing_Scripts`` directory, while example source file headers are provided in the ``emission_source_files_example`` directory. The principal tool script is ``MAIN_emission_processing.ncl``. At the head of this script you can set the run-time options controlling the process of emission generation, the rest of the script organises the calling of the processing functions (in scripts ``diurnal_cycle_routines.ncl``, ``preprocess_emissions_routines.ncl``, ``speciating_emissions_routines.ncl``, and ``vertical_distribution_routines.ncl``). Settings for the different input and output schemes, and data for the different processing options, are stored in a variety of files ending ``*data.ncl``


## Dependencies<a name="Dependencies"></a>

WRF_UoM_EMIT has been written in NCL (https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/); it has been tested with version 6.3.0. Input files are generated using anthro_emis (https://www2.acom.ucar.edu/wrf-chem/wrf-chem-tools-community); example configuration scripts for using this tool with EDGAR-HTAP emissions datasets are available in this repository: https://github.com/douglowe/PROMOTE-emissions .

## Inputs<a name="Inputs"></a>

WRF_UoM_EMIT takes two sets of input files. The first are general emission variables, the second are the NMVOC emission variables. 

The general emission variables should be in input files with the following naming convention:
wrfchemi\_[HH]z\_[domain]\_[YYYY]\_[MM]

The NMVOC emission variables should be in input files with the following naming convention:
wrfchemi\_[HH]z\_NMVOC\_[domain]\_[YYYY]\_[MM]

[HH] will be the hour of day (either 00 or 12 - as generated by anthro_emis using option **XX**). [domain] will be the model domain (d01, d02, etc), [YYYY] will be a 4-digit year, and [MM] will be a 2 digit month.

The standard input datasets supported are:
* EDGAR-HTAP
* SAFAR

The NMVOC input datasets supported are:
* MACCity
* EDGAR v4.3.2

These lists will be amended as more options are added.

## Outputs<a name="Outputs"></a>

WRF_UoM_EMIT creates a single set of input files, containing WRF-Chem emission scheme specific inputs. The naming convention followed is the same as that for the input files: `wrfchemi_[HH]z_[domain]_[YYYY]_[MM]`.

The WRF-Chem input schemes that are supported are:
* `cbmz_mos_orig`:
  * Emissions for CBM-Z gas-phase, and MOSAIC aerosol, schemes
  * WRF-Chem namelist options: `emiss_opt = 4` (ecbmz_mosaic) and `emiss_inpt_opt = 101` (emiss_inpt_pnnl_cm)
  * config option: `wrfchem_scheme = "cbmz_mos_orig"`
* `cri_mos_edgar_htap`:
  * Emissions for CRIv2R5 gas-phase, and MOSAIC aerosol, schemes
  * WRF-Chem namelist options: `emiss_opt = 20` (ecrimechtno) and `emiss_inpt_opt = 121` (emiss_inpt_tno)
  * config option: `wrfchem_scheme = "cri_mos_edgar_htap"`
* `cbmz_mos_htap`:
  * Emissions for CBM-Z gas-phase, and MOSAIC aerosol, schemes
  * only usable with WRF-Chem code inluding local UoM modifications - ask for more information 
  * WRF-Chem namelist options: `emiss_opt = 25` (ecbmz_mos_htap) and `emiss_inpt_opt = 122` (emiss_inpt_htap)
  * config option: `wrfchem_scheme = "cbmz_mos_htap"`


This list will be amended as more options are added.

## Methodology<a name="Methodology"></a>

Emissions processing is divided (roughly) into three steps, corresponding to the process logical controllers listed in [Run-time Options](Run-time-Options): 1) preprocessing of input emissions to add diurnal cycles, ensure conformity of aerosol emissions, and the regional modification of emission inputs (if needed); 2) distribution of emissions vertically; 3) mapping of input emissions to the desired WRF-Chem scheme (including VOC mapping, and NOx fractionation). Below the key features of these processes will be described, while more detailed information will be given on the [wiki](https://github.com/douglowe/WRF_UoM_EMIT/wiki).

The script takes input files from the directory defined by `SOURCEDIR`, stores intermediate files after step 1 in the `DIUDIR` directory, then can store intermediate files after step 2 in the `VERTDIR` directory, and outputs the final WRF-Chem input files in the `OUTDIR` directory.

### Diurnal Cycle and UTC Offset<a name="Diurnal-cycle"></a>

Diurnal cycle information is taken from Olivier et al. (2003), based on Western European data, for the following sectors: power, industrial, residential, solvent use, traffic, and agriculture. The representativity of these cycles for activity in other regions is highly uncertain. These factors are stored as hourly scaling factors within the `diurnal_cycles` arrays in `emission_script_data.ncl` - change these arrays if you wish to use diurnal cycle information that is more suitable for your region of interest.

Diurnal cycles are superimposed using the routines within `diurnal_cycle_routines.ncl`. The first step is determining whether any offsets from UTC are needed (by setting the `UTC_offset` logical operation); then if so whether a single fixed offset for the whole domain (by setting `UTC_offset@method = fixed` and defining a value for `UTC_offset@fixed_offset`) is to be used, or if the offset should be calculated for each grid cell using timezone information (by setting `UTC_offset@method = timezones`).

Timezones are defined using shapefiles which have been downloaded from [http://efele.net/maps/tz/world/](http://efele.net/maps/tz/world/), and are stored in the `shape_files` directory. These shapefiles cover timezones on land only, sea zones will be assumed to be in UTC (which is okay at the moment, as no diurnal variation is given for ship emissions). The timezone that each grid square is in is determined using the routines in `shapefiles_manipulate.ncl` (adapted from [https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Applications/Scripts/shapefile_utils.ncl](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Applications/Scripts/shapefile_utils.ncl)), and then the UTC offset is determined using data stored in `timezone_data.ncl`, which includes both summer and daylight saving time offsets for each timezone region. The choice of which to use is controlled using the `UTC_offset@daylightsaving` logical operator - currently this has to be hardset by the user as the changeover date varies from region to region, and year to year, so this calculation has not been included in the model routines.

The final UTC offset values are stored to the intermediate emission datafiles in the `TZ_Offset` variable, so can be checked after this process to ensure they are correct. It should be noted that the timezone offset method relies on the land/sea boundaries in the timezone shapefiles and in the emissions data to roughly match. Where these do not (as can happen with coarse resolution emission datasets mapped onto high resolution model domains), then emissions along the coastline can be left without a UTC offset of zero. For these high resolution domains it is recommended, for the moment, to use a fixed UTC offset value.

### Conforming Aerosol Emissions<a name="Conforming-aerosols"></a>

Aerosol emissions for each sector are conformed in a three stage process, using routines in the `preprocess_emissions_routines.ncl` module. Firstly the organic carbon (OC) emissions data provided is scaled by the `oc_om_scale` factor, to give a mass value for organic matter (OM) emissions (which is what WRF-Chem expects). Currently one scaling factor is used for all emission sectors. Secondly the PM2.5 emissions for each sector are compared with the summed black carbon (BC) and OM emissions, and increased to match the BC+OM sum if they are lower. Finally the PM10 emissions for each sector are compared with the PM2.5 emissions, and again increased to match this if they are lower.

### Regional Modification of Emissions<a name="Regional-modification"></a>

Emission variables can be modified within a defined rectangular region using routines in the `preprocess_emissions_routines.ncl` module. To do this the `regional_modification_of_emissions` flag needs to be set to True. The limits of the region are defined by maximum and minimum latitude and longitude values, and matching lists of the names of the variables to be modified, and the scaling factor to be applied, must be supplied as attributes for the `regional_modification_of_emissions` variable.

### Vertical Distribution of Emissions<a name="Vertical-distribution"></a>

Vertical distributions for each emission variable are applied using routines in the `vertical_distribution_routines.ncl` module. These simply apportion emissions across a number of emission levels according to fractional distributions for each sector, using definitions stored in the `scheme_vertical_dist.ncl` file. The provided example vertical distributions add predominately area emissions to the lowest 2 model levels, but treat industrial (IND) and power station (POW) emissions as small and large point sources (respectively), which should be emitted at higher elevations (roughly estimated to be about 300m above ground level for large point sources) (after the EPRES tool, personal communication, Yafang Cheng). Because emissions are mapped directly to WRF-Chem model levels, the exact elevation of these emissions will depend on the setup of your model domain. Users are strongly encouraged to check the vertical distribution of their model levels, to decide if the given vertical distributions are suitable or not.
